# Fly-Fight

This is the first game I ever fully completed with Unity and C#. Over all as a game it is far too diffcult and over all level design is a mess. That is not why
I decided to make though. I decided to make it to practise C# in a way that is fun for me. Also as someone who always liked games I was very intrested how they 
are made and what makes them tick.

Game Mechanics -
  -Player fly's in positive X direction while controlling the Z rotation with the up/down arrow keys
  -Player can shoot projectiles which impact with enemies (enemies will die if tehir health drops low enough)
  -Player can use a momentary speed boost which has a slight cool down on it
  -If player collides an enemy or obstacles the game gets reset
  -Player has a blue energy bar which when it runs out player will start falling 
  -Energy bar can be restored by pick ups (and will give player the ability to fly again even if the bar has reached zero)
  -Top right counter counts how many projectiles the player has available (ammo)
  -Ammo can be gained through pick ups
  -In the top middle there is a score counter which goes up if gold coins are collected
  -A misile will spawn at set intervals of time, awlways on the Y position of the player but greater X position that the player 
  to allow enough for the player to dodge
  -Enemies move along the Y axis and can be killed with player's projectiles
  
 Improvements for next time-
  -A lot of effort was put into the game mechanics but not a lot went into game design, that would be my imrovemnts for nect time
  -Make the game flow better and make it easier
  -Add animation
